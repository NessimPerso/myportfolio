##### About the company & the team  
ZOS IS is a Web development and mobile application agency in the healthcare field.
Under the supervision of the CTO who manages the various incoming projects, we had team coordination with weekly check-ins, but each developer had a specific scope. I was in charge of developing the platform for healthcare providers who can track the progress of different patients' files and who intervene at home. Autonomous Development Team.

##### My missions

- Application development (React, PHP)
- Back-end management (SQL).
- Website development (Wordpress)
- Technology monitoring

##### Tech stack 
Frontend in React, Backend in PHP and Databases MySQL.

##### A success
 I implement an algorithm to help technicians process alerts sent to the application. With a dynamic display thanks to state management with Redux. I worked on the front-end aspect, and on the logic for implementing and recording the answers given during the form.
This was a real highlight, as I had the autonomy to come up with the implementation logic for this algorithm, which I then validated with my boss.
