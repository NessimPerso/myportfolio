##### About the company 

Development of applications for monitoring cancer patients.
Unicancer is the only French hospital network 100% dedicated to cancer care. The company has 250 employees, and the Data & IS department is made up of around 50 people. For each major project, we have a project team made up of : A functional project manager, an IT pilot, one or more developers, a test and validation team. A Kanban approach.

##### My main project
The ESMÃ‰ program is the largest real-life data platform tracking patients treated for cancer in France. 
I was in charge of creating interfaces, the business logic behind them and the relevance of the output data.


##### My missions

- Application development (PHP, JavaScript)
- Code management, deployment in test and production environments.
- Back-end management (SQL).
- Technology monitoring

##### Tech
Html/CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap for Front, PHP for Back, SQL and PL/SQL for Oracle Databases.

##### A success 
 Implementation of the G8 form is a geriatric screening tool that enables oncologists to identify, among elderly cancer patients, those who should benefit from an in-depth geriatric assessment. So I had to create the content of the form and the database responses, while at the same time creating the form's interface.
It's challenging for me because I was involved in this process from the gathering of needs between the medical team and the functional and technical project managers, right through to the production launch.
