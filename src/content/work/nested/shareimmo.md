##### About the company
ShareImmo is an academic project aimed at innovating within the real estate investment landscape through blockchain technology. Developed as part of a final-year academic program, ShareImmo focuses on applying Web3 principles to enable fractional property ownership. Our interdisciplinary team consists of students specializing in blockchain development, business strategy, and finance. We've structured our approach around building a solid business plan, conducting comprehensive market research, and benchmarking similar platforms.

##### My main project
The core of ShareImmo is a decentralized platform that tokenizes real estate assets, allowing users to buy, sell, and trade shares of properties with ease. My primary role was developing a prototype for the platform, creating smart contracts, and working on the market analysis that supports the project’s feasibility.

##### My missions
- Development of a proof-of-concept platform with smart contract integration (Solidity, Web3)
- Market research, competitive analysis, and establishing a business plan
- Benchmarking existing blockchain-based real estate platforms to define competitive edges
- User interface design for a smooth token trading experience

##### Tech
JavaScript, React, Web3.js for the front end; Solidity for smart contracts; Node.js for backend integration; data analysis for market research.

##### A success
Our research and development phase included surveying over 100 potential users and collecting feedback, which has been crucial in validating the project’s concept. This experience was a key success for us as students, allowing us to refine our prototype and business approach based on real market insights.
